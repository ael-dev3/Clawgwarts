# Gather Town - Pixel Art Digital Workspace Notes

Overview / How it works
- Gather uses spatial video chat: audio/video gets clearer as avatars get closer and fades with distance. Connection starts at 5 tiles and is full within 2 tiles; private areas, quiet mode, ghost mode, and DND change this behavior.
- Movement is grid-based: one keypress moves one tile; tiles are 32x32 pixels. This grid is the basis for all map design and pixel art assets.

Map scale and layout
- Spaces are built from Maps (Rooms). A map maxes at 3200x3200 px (100x100 tiles); spaces can contain multiple maps.
- Background/foreground images must be PNG/JPG (foreground must be PNG), under 3 MB, sized to multiples of 32, and under 3200x3200; background and foreground must match dimensions.
- Avatars are ~30-36 px tall and overlap the tile above, which matters for how tall objects/walls should look.

Objects and interactions (workspace behavior)
- Objects can be interactive; interactions include embedded websites/images/videos, external calls, or note objects. This lets desks, whiteboards, or TVs act like real tools in a digital workspace.
- Custom objects can be uploaded; Gather recommends matching its pixel art style. Tiles are 32x32, so object art should be scaled to that grid; use transparent PNGs and resize before upload.
- Interactions are triggered by approaching objects; some objects prompt users to press `x` to interact.

Tile effects (behavior on the grid)
- Mapmaker includes special tile types for effects (impassable, spawn, portal, private area, spotlight). These are applied per tile to control movement and behavior.
